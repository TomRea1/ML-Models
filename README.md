Hey ! 
I'm a masters student in AI/ML and you found my GitHub repo. 

This repo is kind of a mess of different ML models I've been learning about and playing with but I've tried to document 
each of them as much as possible both to solidify my own understanding of the underlying math and to help anyone who may come 
across this repo and wants to learn with me. 

All the models in this repo are bare bones implementations purely written out to play with and get comfortable with the structure and math. 
If you're here looking for projects you might want to check out some of my other repos but you won't find what you're looking for here. This is 
purely academic : the boring part before we get to the cool shit. 

If you spot any holes in my understanding of models please reach out, I'm always willing to learn and be proved wrong. Otherwise, 
please enjoy !
